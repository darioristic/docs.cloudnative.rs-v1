# Introduction

# Cloud Native Internal Documentation v0

Welcome to the **Cloud Native Internal Documentation Hub**.  
This space exists as a central point of reference for everything related to how we design, deliver, and operate cloud-native solutions. Unlike a static manual or a scattered collection of files, this hub is designed to be a living knowledge base that combines strategy, methodology, and hands-on resources in one place. It allows different parts of the organization—Sales, Engineering, Leadership, and new team members—to operate with a shared understanding of our values, standards, and practices.

The ultimate goal is to reduce uncertainty, speed up decision-making, and ensure that we consistently deliver reliable results to our clients. By consolidating knowledge, we avoid duplication of effort, prevent gaps in communication, and build a stronger foundation for collaboration. Over time, this documentation should grow into the single most reliable internal resource for how we work.

## Purpose of This Documentation

The purpose of this documentation is to bring clarity, structure, and alignment to our work. In any organization that spans multiple roles and functions, there is a natural risk of fragmentation—sales teams focus on narratives, engineers on delivery, and leadership on strategic direction. Without a unifying framework, each team might work effectively on its own but struggle to connect with the others.  

This documentation bridges those gaps. It provides the context for why we operate the way we do, sets standards for how to deliver, and offers practical tools that can be applied immediately in day-to-day tasks. Its objectives are:

- **Orientation** – to provide clear entry points into our processes, especially for those who are new or moving between roles. Orientation ensures that no one needs to start from zero or depend solely on informal knowledge transfer.  
- **Consistency** – to establish practices and language that remain aligned across all teams, so we present a unified message to clients and operate with predictable standards internally.  
- **Enablement** – to reduce friction in daily work by offering checklists, templates, and playbooks that allow teams to execute quickly and confidently.  
- **Collaboration** – to act as a shared reference point where both business and technical teams can rely on the same information, eliminating unnecessary miscommunication.  

This is not a static archive. Every project, client engagement, or shift in technology should feed back into the documentation. It is intended to evolve with us, reflecting both the challenges we encounter and the solutions we develop.

## Quick start

To start using Nextra, you need to select a theme first:

<Cards num={2}>
  <Cards.Card arrow title="Documentation theme" href="/docs/docs-theme/start">
    <>![Documentation theme screenshot](/assets/docs-theme.png)</>
  </Cards.Card>
  <Cards.Card arrow title="Blog theme" href="/docs/blog-theme/start">
    <>![Blog theme screenshot](/assets/blog-theme.png)</>
  </Cards.Card>
</Cards>

If you want to use Nextra without using these built-in themes, you can follow
the [Custom Theme](/docs/custom-theme) docs.

## Main Sections and Ownership

The internal documentation is organized into two **primary sections**, each maintained by a dedicated team to ensure relevance, accuracy, and continuous improvement:

### 1. Engineering
Maintained by the **Engineering Team**, this section covers all technical aspects of cloud-native solutions. It includes platform principles, deployment standards, automation strategies, operations practices, and monitoring guidelines. Engineering is responsible for keeping this section up-to-date with best practices, new tools, and lessons learned from live deployments. It serves as a reference for both internal engineering staff and other teams seeking technical context.

### 2. Sales
Maintained by the **Sales Team**, this section focuses on external engagement and messaging. It contains value propositions, client narratives, case studies, playbooks, and guidance for effective communication. The Sales team ensures that this section accurately reflects current offerings and aligns messaging with what the Engineering team can deliver. This ensures that client interactions are consistent and grounded in real capabilities.

These two sections form the backbone of the documentation. All other supporting materials, templates, checklists, and references are organized around these primary areas to provide context and practical utility.

## FAQ

The Nextra FAQ is a collection of useful questions and answers about the
project. If you have a question that isn't answered here, please

<details>
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <summary>Can I use Nextra with Next.js `pages` router?</summary>
Nextra 4 only works with the `app` router. Only Nextra 1/2/3 supports the
`pages` router.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I use X with Nextra?</summary>
The answer is "yes" for most things. Since Nextra is just a Next.js plugin, almost all the things
that can be done with React can be done with Nextra. Here are some examples and guides:

- [Use Tailwind CSS](/docs/guide/tailwind-css)
- [Use custom CSS and Sass](/docs/guide/custom-css)
- [Use custom fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization)

  <summary>How can I add a live coding component in Nextra?</summary>
There are libraries like [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io) and
[react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live) that can help you
add live coding components to your MDX.
