# Backup and Disaster Recovery

Backup and Disaster Recovery (BDR) is a critical component of cloud-native operations that ensures business continuity and data protection. This guide covers strategies, tools, and best practices for implementing comprehensive backup and disaster recovery solutions.

## Overview

Disaster recovery planning involves preparing for and recovering from events that could disrupt business operations, including natural disasters, cyber attacks, system failures, and human errors. In cloud-native environments, this requires careful consideration of distributed systems, data consistency, and rapid recovery capabilities.

## Backup Strategies

### 3-2-1 Backup Rule

Follow the industry-standard 3-2-1 backup rule:

- **3 copies** of your data
- **2 different storage media**
- **1 copy stored offsite**

### Backup Types

#### Full Backups
- Complete copy of all data
- Longer backup time but faster restore
- Higher storage requirements
- Typically performed weekly or monthly

#### Incremental Backups
- Only changed data since last backup
- Faster backup time
- Requires full backup plus all incrementals for restore
- Typically performed daily

#### Differential Backups
- Changed data since last full backup
- Moderate backup time
- Requires full backup plus latest differential for restore
- Balance between speed and restore complexity

### Application-Level Backups

#### Database Backups
- **Point-in-time recovery (PITR)**
- **Transaction log backups**
- **Consistent snapshots**
- **Cross-region replication**

#### Container and Kubernetes Backups
- **Etcd backup for Kubernetes clusters**
- **Application configuration backups**
- **Persistent volume snapshots**
- **Helm chart and manifest backups**

## Disaster Recovery Strategies

### Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

Define your business requirements:

- **RTO**: Maximum acceptable downtime
- **RPO**: Maximum acceptable data loss

### Disaster Recovery Architectures

#### Active-Passive (Cold Standby)
- Secondary site ready but not running
- Longer RTO but lower cost
- Suitable for non-critical applications

#### Active-Passive (Warm Standby)
- Secondary site partially active
- Moderate RTO and cost
- Good balance for most applications

#### Active-Active (Hot Standby)
- Multiple active sites
- Lowest RTO but highest cost
- Critical for mission-critical applications

#### Pilot Light
- Minimal resources in DR site
- Quick scaling when needed
- Cost-effective for many scenarios
