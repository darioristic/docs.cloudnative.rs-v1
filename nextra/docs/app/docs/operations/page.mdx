# Operations

The **Operations** section provides a comprehensive framework for maintaining, monitoring, and supporting enterprise-grade OpenShift and cloud-native platforms.  
Its purpose is to ensure that all deployed clusters remain **secure, stable, scalable, and aligned with customer requirements** throughout their lifecycle.  

Operations documentation is divided into specialized topics maintained by the **Engineering** and **Sales** teams, enabling both technical experts and customer-facing staff to collaborate effectively.
