# Overview

This section provides guidance on **installing and configuring OpenShift clusters** for enterprise clients. It covers prerequisites, planning, deployment strategies, and post-installation validation. It is maintained by the **Engineering Team** and intended for platform engineers and system administrators responsible for delivering secure, scalable, and reliable OpenShift environments.

---

## 1. Pre-Installation Planning
- **Requirements Gathering**  
  - Client objectives: workloads, compliance, high availability, and scaling needs.  
  - Hardware and virtualization requirements: CPU, RAM, storage, network topology.  
  - Security and compliance constraints: firewalls, access policies, audit requirements.

- **Environment Design**  
  - Decide on cluster topology: single-region, multi-region, high-availability setup.  
  - Determine network layout: VLANs, subnets, load balancers, and ingress/egress rules.  
  - Storage planning: persistent volume strategy, storage classes, and backups.  

- **OpenShift Versioning and Licensing**  
  - Confirm the OpenShift version based on client requirements.  
  - License management and subscription setup.  
  - Plan for future upgrades and patch cycles.

---

## 2. Prerequisites and Preparation
- Hardware provisioning or virtual machine configuration.  
- DNS setup and certificate management for cluster components.  
- Firewall and port requirements for control plane and worker nodes.  
- Installation of required tools on bootstrap machines (e.g., `openshift-install`, `oc` CLI).  
- Validation of connectivity between nodes, load balancers, and external services.

---

## 3. Installation Methods
- **IPI (Installer Provisioned Infrastructure)**  
  - Automates infrastructure setup on supported cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).  
  - Recommended for new cloud deployments where automation is preferred.  

- **UPI (User Provisioned Infrastructure)**  
  - Manual infrastructure setup for advanced or on-premises environments.  
  - Allows full control over network, storage, and nodes configuration.  

- **Bare Metal / On-Prem Installation**  
  - Considerations for physical servers: node sizing, networking, and storage.  
  - Integration with virtualization or hyperconverged environments if required.

---

## 4. Cluster Configuration
- Setting up **control plane and worker nodes**.  
- Configuring **high availability** and **load balancing**.  
- Networking configuration: SDN, ingress controllers, and service routing.  
- Security hardening: RBAC policies, SELinux, audit logging, and pod security policies.  
- Authentication and identity providers: LDAP, Active Directory, OAuth.  

---

## 5. Post-Installation Validation
- Verify cluster health using `oc` commands and OpenShift console.  
- Validate node status, networking, storage, and API access.  
- Test cluster upgrade and rollback procedures in a controlled environment.  
- Configure monitoring and alerting for cluster metrics.  

---

## 6. Documentation and Handover
- Create a deployment report including:
  - Cluster architecture diagram.  
  - Node specifications and configurations.  
  - Networking and storage details.  
  - Security and compliance settings.  

- Provide **handover materials** to client operations teams:
  - Admin and developer access instructions.  
  - Maintenance and upgrade guidelines.  
  - Runbooks for common operational tasks.  

---

## 7. References and Templates
- Sample installation manifests (UPI and IPI).  
- Checklist for pre-installation readiness.  
- Standard post-installation validation scripts.  
- Links to internal playbooks, troubleshooting guides, and training resources.

This section ensures that every OpenShift cluster installation is **standardized, repeatable, and aligned with enterprise best practices**, while providing the engineering team with a clear framework to plan, deploy, and hand over production-ready environments.
