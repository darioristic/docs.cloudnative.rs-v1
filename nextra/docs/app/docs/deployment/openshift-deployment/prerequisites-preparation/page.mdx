  - Collaboration and change tracking

- **Terraform/Ansible**
  - Infrastructure as Code tools
  - Automated provisioning and configuration
  - State management and rollback capabilities

## Environment Validation

### Connectivity Testing
- **Node-to-Node Communication**
  - Test network connectivity between all nodes
  - Verify load balancer configuration
  - Validate DNS resolution

- **External Connectivity**
  - Test internet access for package downloads
  - Verify access to container registries
  - Validate external service connectivity

### Resource Validation
- **CPU and Memory**
  - Verify sufficient resources on all nodes
  - Test resource allocation and limits
  - Validate performance under load

- **Storage Validation**
  - Test storage connectivity and performance
  - Verify storage class configuration
  - Validate backup and restore procedures

## Security Preparation

### Access Control
- **User Accounts**
  - Create administrative user accounts
  - Set up role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Configure authentication providers

- **SSH Access**
  - Configure SSH keys for node access
  - Set up secure remote access
  - Implement access logging and monitoring

### Security Hardening
- **Operating System**
  - Apply security patches and updates
  - Configure SELinux and AppArmor
  - Implement security policies

- **Network Security**
  - Configure network segmentation
  - Set up intrusion detection
  - Implement traffic monitoring
