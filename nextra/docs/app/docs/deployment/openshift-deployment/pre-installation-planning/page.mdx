  - Cross-region networking
  - Data replication and synchronization

#### High-Availability Setup
- **Control Plane HA**
  - 3 or more control plane nodes
  - Load balancer for API server access
  - Etcd cluster for configuration storage

- **Application HA**
  - Multiple worker nodes across zones
  - Pod anti-affinity rules
  - Health checks and auto-recovery

### Network Layout

#### VLAN Configuration
- **Management VLAN**
  - Cluster administration and monitoring
  - Secure access to control plane nodes
  - Isolated from application traffic

- **Application VLAN**
  - Pod-to-pod communication
  - Service mesh and ingress traffic
  - Load balancer integration

- **Storage VLAN**
  - Persistent volume access
  - Backup and replication traffic
  - High-bandwidth requirements

#### Subnet Planning
- **Pod Networks**
  - Allocate sufficient IP ranges for pods
  - Consider cluster growth and scaling
  - Plan for multiple clusters if needed

- **Service Networks**
  - Internal service communication
  - Load balancer IP allocation
  - External access configuration

### Storage Planning

#### Persistent Volume Strategy
- **Storage Classes**
  - Define different storage tiers
  - Performance and cost optimization
  - Backup and retention policies

- **Volume Provisioning**
  - Dynamic provisioning for applications
  - Static provisioning for specific needs
  - Volume snapshots and cloning

#### Backup Strategy
- **Data Backup**
  - Application data backup
  - Configuration backup
  - Disaster recovery procedures

- **Cluster Backup**
  - Etcd backup and restore
  - Cluster configuration backup
  - Recovery testing and validation

## OpenShift Versioning and Licensing
