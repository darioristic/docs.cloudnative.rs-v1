# OpenShift Deployment Checklist

This checklist is designed to guide Engineering Teams through the **planning, installation, and validation of OpenShift clusters** for enterprise clients.  
It provides a **step-by-step framework** to ensure deployments are consistent, secure, and aligned with best practices.  

The checklist is divided by **infrastructure type**—VMware, Bare Metal, and Hyperscaler (AWS, Azure, GCP)—because each environment has unique requirements and considerations.  
By following this structured approach, engineers can:

- ✅ Reduce errors and oversights during installation  
- ✅ Ensure high availability, security, and compliance  
- ✅ Standardize deployments across different client environments  
- ✅ Provide clear documentation and handover materials to client operations teams

## How to Use This Checklist

1. Start with the **Pre-Installation Planning** steps common to all environments.  
2. Follow the checklist specific to your infrastructure type (VMware, Bare Metal, or Hyperscaler).  
3. Complete **Post-Installation Validation** steps to confirm cluster health and functionality.  
4. Document all configurations, create architecture diagrams, and prepare handover materials.  
5. Refer to templates and internal playbooks for repeatable, automated processes.
