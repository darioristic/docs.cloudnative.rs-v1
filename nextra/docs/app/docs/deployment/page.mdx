# Deployment (OpenShift)

This section provides detailed guidance on deploying and managing applications and platforms using **OpenShift**, ensuring security, scalability, and consistency across all environments. It is maintained by the **Engineering Team** and is intended for engineers, platform operators, and anyone involved in deploying cloud-native solutions.

---

## 1. OpenShift Platform Overview
- Key concepts: Projects, Namespaces, Operators, Pods, Services, Routes, ConfigMaps, Secrets.
- Cluster architecture: control plane, worker nodes, and networking.
- Multi-environment setup: development, staging, production.
- OpenShift versions and upgrade policies.

---

## 2. Deployment Standards
- **Application Deployment Guidelines**  
  - Use declarative manifests (YAML/Helm) for all deployments.  
  - Follow standardized labels and annotations for monitoring, billing, and governance.  
  - Avoid manual edits in production; all changes should go through CI/CD pipelines.

- **Infrastructure Deployment**  
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Ansible or Terraform for cluster provisioning.  
  - Standardized cluster configurations (node sizing, storage classes, networking).  
  - Security hardening following CIS/OpenShift benchmarks.

- **Environment Management**  
  - Separate namespaces per environment (dev, staging, prod).  
  - Environment-specific configurations handled via ConfigMaps and Secrets.  
  - Promotion workflow: dev → staging → prod.

---

## 3. CI/CD Pipelines
- Recommended CI/CD tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton).  
- Pipeline best practices:
  - Automated builds for all commits in the main branch.  
  - Image scanning for security vulnerabilities before deployment.  
  - Automated tests and linting in the pipeline.  
  - Canary or blue/green deployment strategies for production.  

- **Pipeline Templates**
  - Shared reusable templates for application build and deployment.  
  - Examples for microservices, web apps, and batch jobs.

---

## 4. Security and Compliance
- Use **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for cluster access.  
- Secrets management: never commit secrets to Git; use OpenShift Secrets or external vaults.  
- Network policies to enforce pod-to-pod and namespace-to-namespace communication rules.  
- Audit logs and monitoring for compliance and traceability.

---

## 5. Monitoring and Observability
- Integrate with OpenShift Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana).  
- Standard metrics for deployment health, application performance, and resource usage.  
- Alerts configuration and incident response procedures.  
- Logging setup via Elasticsearch / Fluentd / Kibana (EFK) stack.

---

## 6. Rollback and Recovery
- Automated rollback procedures in case of failed deployments.  
- Backup strategies for cluster state, persistent volumes, and critical configurations.  
- Documentation of previous deployment versions for auditing and troubleshooting.

---

## 7. Templates and References
- Sample YAML manifests for common services.  
- Pre-configured OpenShift project templates.  
- CI/CD pipeline templates for Tekton/Jenkins.  
- Links to internal playbooks, best practices, and training materials.

This section ensures that all OpenShift deployments are **consistent, repeatable, and secure**, while providing the Engineering team with practical guidance for daily operations and collaboration with other teams.
