# Observability in OpenShift

The **Observability** section describes how we implement, operate, and extend observability for OpenShift clusters across VMware, bare metal, and hyperscaler environments.  
OpenShift provides a strong foundation for monitoring and logging, but enterprise usage requires **structured practices, custom integrations, and advanced tuning** to ensure reliability, performance, and compliance.

## Why Observability in OpenShift Is Different

OpenShift is not just Kubernetes — it adds platform services, operators, and developer-focused components. This increases complexity and requires **observability beyond standard cluster metrics**.  
Key challenges include:  

- Monitoring both **Kubernetes components and OpenShift operators**.  
- Correlating **application workloads** with **cluster infrastructure**.  
- Integrating OpenShift-native tools with **enterprise observability platforms**.  
- Handling **multi-cluster and hybrid-cloud topologies**.

## Built-In OpenShift Capabilities

OpenShift ships with a pre-integrated observability stack:  

- **Prometheus Operator** – manages metrics collection and alerting.  
- **Grafana** – dashboards for visualizing cluster health and workloads.  
- **Alertmanager** – routing and escalation of alerts.  
- **Cluster Monitoring Operator** – configures monitoring for control plane and user workloads.  
- **OpenShift Logging (EFK or Loki)** – centralized logging for cluster components and applications.  

These provide a solid baseline but often require **customization and scaling** for production.

## Our Observability Framework

For enterprise deployments, we extend OpenShift's defaults with:  

- **Metrics**  
  - SLA/SLO-driven alerting  
  - Custom workload dashboards for customer applications  
  - Long-term metrics storage (e.g., Thanos)  

- **Logs**  
  - Centralized log aggregation with ElasticSearch or Loki  
  - Forwarding logs to external SIEM/SOC systems  
  - Retention and compliance management  

- **Traces**  
  - Jaeger Operator for distributed tracing  
  - Integration with OpenTelemetry  
  - Correlation between traces, metrics, and logs

## Who Owns Observability

- **Engineering Team** – maintains and extends the OpenShift observability stack, ensures integration with enterprise monitoring systems, and owns operational playbooks.  
- **Sales & Customer Success** – use observability reports and SLA dashboards to demonstrate platform reliability and transparency to clients.

## How to Use This Section

This section includes:  

- **Checklists** for setting up observability during cluster installation.  
- **Playbooks** for troubleshooting alerts, logs, and performance issues.  
- **Dashboards & Alerting Templates** for standard OpenShift environments.  
- **Best Practices** for scaling observability in VMware, bare metal, and hyperscaler deployments.  

Observability in OpenShift is not optional — it is the backbone of **Day-2 operations** and the key enabler for delivering trust to enterprise clients.
